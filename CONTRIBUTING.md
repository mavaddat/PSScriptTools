# PSScriptTools Contributions

I welcome contributions and suggestions for this module. If you have a suggestion or problem, please post an issue. Please __do not__ submit a pull request to fix a bug without first opening an issue as I may already be working on the problem. If you want to add an entirely new command through a pull request, create a new, stand-alone function in the `functions` directory and a markdown help document under the `docs`directory. Use the [Platyps](https://github.com/powershell/platyps) module to create the markdown file. When submitting a pull request, __do not__ update the module manifest or external help file. This module includes a documentation PDF that I need to generate with each new release.

If you would like to update command documentation, you are welcome to submit a PR on the markdown file. Or, if it is a simple change, post an issue and I'll take care of it.

If you have any questions about how you can contribute, please post an issue. One area where contributions *would* be welcome is Pester tests.
